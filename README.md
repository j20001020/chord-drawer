# Chord Drawer

Chord Drawer is a Python library that allows you to easily draw guitar chord diagrams. It provides a simple interface to visualize chords based on the fret and string information you provide.

## Features

- Draws guitar chord diagrams for any chord name.
- Supports specifying which frets to press on each string.
- Displays open strings and muted strings clearly.

## Installation

You can install the Chord Drawer library using pip. First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chord-drawer.git
cd chord-drawer
```

Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the Chord Drawer library, you can import it and call the `draw_chord` function with the desired chord name and fret information. Hereâ€™s an example:

```python
from chord_drawer.chord_drawer import draw_chord

# Draw a C major chord
draw_chord("C", [-1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 0])

# Draw a G major chord with a starting fret of 3
draw_chord("G", [3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3], start_fret=3)
```

## Running Tests
